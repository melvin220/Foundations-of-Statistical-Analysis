# Foundations-of-Statistical-Analysis
Foundation of statistical analysis using R

This course provided the foundational knowledge of descriptive statistics. The scope this course is limited to univariate and bivariate statistics that are commonly used to conduct basic analyses of data, including reading-in data, reviewing individual variables and their properties, conducting any requisite data corrections and enhancements, developing an overall descriptive baseline, and taking initial steps into discovering and testing possible relationships; I will also be introducing the basics of probability and sampling theories. Topic wise, I developed an understanding of numerous core statistical notions, including variable types and the underlying measurement scales, variable distributions, sampling distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, Bayes Theorem, measures of central tendency and variance, statistical significance, hypothesis testing, tests of difference, as well as correlation and cross-tabulation.
